# 🎵 Metrolist (Aqua Dynamics Spoofed Spotify Package)

This is a **modified version of Metrolist** (GPLv3) with a **spoofed package name (`com.spotify.music`)** to **trigger Aqua Dynamics (aka Dynamic Island)** on devices running **ColorOS 15 and OxygenOS 15**.

✅ Everything else in the app is untouched.  
🚫 No Spotify functionality is included or imitated.

---

## 🛠️ What This Does

- ✅ Spoofs package name to `com.spotify.music`
- 🔓 Unlocks Aqua Dynamics animations when music plays
- 🔄 App icon and name changed to look like Spotify
- ⚙️ All functionality still comes from original Metrolist

---

## 📱 Requirements

- Android with **ColorOS 15+** or **OxygenOS 15+**
- Uninstall real Spotify (if installed)
- Disable **auto-updates** for Spotify on Play Store

---

## 📥 How to Install

1. Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/KarthikeyaSarvan/metrolist-dynamic-island/releases)** tab.
2. Download the latest `metrolist-spotify.apk`.
3. Install using your file manager.
4. If you get a **Play Protect warning**, tap:
   > **More details → Install anyway**

## ⚠️ Warnings

- ❌ **Do NOT install the real Spotify app** — it shares the same package name and will overwrite this app.
- ⚙️ Go to Play Store → Spotify → ⋮ menu → **Disable auto-updates**
- This APK only changes **package and label names** — no functional changes were made.
- ❗ If the app crashes or doesn’t behave as expected, **report it to the original Metrolist repo**, not here.
